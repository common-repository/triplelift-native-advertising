== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is native advertising? =

Native advertising is a form of advertising that is more tightly integrated
into a publisher's website. TripleLift uses ads that are clearly marked as
sponsored, but otherwise fit the look and feel of a publisher's site, to
deliver highly relevant, beautiful ads (that don't flash and blink). You can
learn more here: http://triplelift.com/pub-info?r=wp

= Do I need to be a customer of TripleLift to use this plugin =

You can install the TripleLift Native Advertising Plugin and view the code without being a customer, but having the code inject working native ads into your site will require that you be a customer of TripleLift. Please reach out to us at info [at] triplelift [dot] com

= Will this plugin change the code of my posts =

No. It will inject native advertising between your posts. 

= What's the difference between native ads and banner ads =

Banner ads flash and blank, and come in one of a set of pre-define shapes and sizes. Our native ads are pure HTML, not flash - so they don't slow down your site. They automatically work with the look and feel of your site, so you don't have to design your site around banner ads. 

= Can I traffic native ad tags in my existing adserver =

Yes. Our native ad tags work in conjunction with all major ad server such as DFP, OAS, ADTECH, and more. The only requirement if that you utilize friendly iframe tags. It may make sense to reach out to us at support [at] triplelift [dot] com to help you decide whether the plugin is the right option.

= What types of brands will run on my site =

We exclusively work with top 500 brands across a wide variety of categories, and it's completely up to you as to which brands and/or categories you'd like to run on our site as configured in the console.

= Will sponsored content be clearly delineated from organic content =

Yes. We require all placements to be delineated; however, the manner by which you do so is completely customizable either by our design team or yours.

= How will I get paid =

You will get paid based a combination of viewable impressions and organic engagement including but not limited to mouseovers, clicks, and shares to social.

= What happens if my reserve price is not met =

If your reserve price is not met, no ad will be served and our tag will stay collapsed so we don't impact the user experience at all. Alternatively, we can default to serving passbacks to other advertising technology partners you may work with.

= Can I use your native ad technology with brands I work with directly =

Yes. Many publishers who manage their own sales choose to license our native ad technology for use with their existing advertisers.

= Will this slow down my page =

Absolutely not. Our tags fetch content asynchronously from blazing fast CDNs located in 30 data centers around the world.
